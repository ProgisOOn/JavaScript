the opening brace on the same line as the corresponding keyword

Always enclose statements and expressions in curly braces
even if it's short

No one likes to read a long horizontal line of code. It’s best
practice to split them.
And, for if statements:
############################################################
if (
  id === 123 &&
  moonPhase === 'Waning Gibbous' &&
  zodiacSign === 'Libra'
) {
  letTheSorceryBegin();
}
#######################################################################

The maximum line length should be agreed upon at the team-level.
It’s usually 80 or 120 characters.

Insert an extra newline where it helps to make the code more readable.
There should not be more than nine lines of code without a vertical
indentation.

Code first, then functions
Most of time, this variant is preferred.


For instance, for ESLint you should do the following:

Install Node.js.
Install ESLint with the command

npm install -g eslint

(npm is a JavaScript package installer).

Create a config file named -> .eslintrc
in the root of your JavaScript project 
(in the folder that contains all your files).

Install/enable the plugin for your editor that
integrates with ESLint. The majority of editors have one.

function pow(x, n){
  let result=1;

  for(let i=0;i<n;i++) {
    result*=x;
    }
  return result;
}

let x = prompt("x?", ''),
    n = prompt("n?", '');
if (n<=0) {
  alert(`Power ${n} is not supported, please enter an
         integer number greater than zero`);
  } else {
  alert( pow(x, n) );
}
